                                    We will go snowshoeing at Särkitunturi fell, one of the most popular day trip destinations in Levi area. From this fell you can see the beautiful views to the surrounding Pallas-Ylläs national park. There we feel the real peace of Lapland in the magical arctic wild nature. Silence of the fell is mesmerizing.

                                    We start hiking uphill in a gently sloping forest towards the top of the fell. We possibly can hike all the way to the top if the weather permits. On a clear day the view is astonishing. Physically it is accessible by almost anyone with normal conditioning. Going uphill is an excellent way to get safe and effective exercise! You will get some fresh air as well: Just some kilometers away from Särkitunturi is the place where is measured the cleanest air in Europe.

With Juki Tours the schedule is loose, and in Lapland we always have time for some fishing and relaxing without a busy feeling. Here you can get the holiday feeling you are looking for. There is a silent lake between the fells, you can only hear the wind in the trees and on the snow.
